        <h2>Description</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>12 ounces spaghetti</li>

                <li>1/2 onion, diced</li>
                
                <li>2 garlic cloves, pressed</li>
                
                <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
                
                <li>1/4 cup gochujang red chile paste</li>
                
                <li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream</li>
                
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
                
                <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>

            <li><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook spaghetti, stirring occasionally,</p> 
                <p>until tender with a bite, about 12 minutes. Scoop out 1/2 cup pasta water; set aside. Drain spaghetti.</p></li>

            <li><p>Cook and stir ground beef, bell pepper, and onion together in a large skillet, until meat and vegetables are browned, 6 to 7 minutes.</p> 
                <p>Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Drain any excess grease and discard.</p></li>

            <li><p>Add tomato paste and gochujang to meat, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring constantly, about 3 to 4 minutes.</p> 
                <p>Add heavy whipping cream, and cook and stir until fully incorporated. Season with salt and pepper.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Add cooked spaghetti to meat mixture; stir in Parmesan cheese. If sauce is too thick,</p> 
                <p>add reserved pasta water, 2 tablespoons at a time, to thin to desired consistency.</p></li>

        </ol>
