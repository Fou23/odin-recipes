        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>

            <li><p>For dough, mix yeast and water and let stand for 10 minutes.</p>
                 <p> Add flour and salt, and stir with a wooden spoon for 2 minutes to form a soft, sticky dough.</p>
                     <p>Slice down sides of bowl, cover, and let rise in a cool spot until doubled in size, 8 to 12 hours.</p></li>

            <li><p>Use a wet hand to deflate and de-gas the dough, and form into a ball. Cover and store in the refrigerator until needed.</p></li> 
                
            <li><p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Pierce sweet potatoes with a knife and place on a baking sheet.</p></li>
                
            <li><p>Roast in the preheated oven until soft, about 1 hour. Let cool until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.</p></li>
                
            <li><p>Scoop sweet potato flesh into a bowlâ€”you will need about 2 1/2 cups.</p> 
                <p>Add salt, black pepper, cayenne, olive oil, rosemary, lemon zest, and lemon juice, and mash until smooth.</p> 
                <p>Stir in Parmigiano Reggiano, and taste for seasoning. Set aside.</p></li>
                
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C).</li>
                
            <li><p>Add bacon to a cold, dry, nonstick skillet. Place over medium-high heat, and cook, separating bacon pieces with tongs,</p>
                 <p>until almost crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels; set aside.</p></li>
                
            <li><p>To assemble pizza, pour olive oil on a sheet pan and spread over evenly; place on dough, and use oiled hands to press out to the edges.</p> 
                <p>If dough is very elastic, let dough rest and relax for a few minutes, then continue to stretch.</p> 
                <p>Repeat this process as needed to stretch dough to cover the pan.</p></li>
                
            <li><p>Dollop sweet potato mixture onto dough; Spread a thin layer over crust with the back of a spoon.</p>
                 <p>Top evenly with mozzarella, bacon, fontina, and jalapenos. Finish with another dusting of Parmigiano Reggiano.</p></li>
                
            <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden, and cheese is browned, 30 to 35 minutes.</p> 
                <p>Remove from oven; cool in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a board and slice with a pizza cutter.</p></li>
